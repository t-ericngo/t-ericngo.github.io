Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of Iowa.

My primary research interests lie at the nexus of international relations, foreign policy, comparative politics, and computational social science (CSS). In my ongoing dissertation project, I explore how networks of political elites influence constraints on the top leader, thereby shaping policy and political outcomes such as international conflict, repression, and elite in-fighting. To do this, I construct an original database of elite networks across countries and years, employing fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to extract information about elites' biographies and relationships.

More broadly, I am interested in te interplay between domestic and international elements and their implications to state behavior. In my other work, I examine how domestic factors such as ethnic inequality and political institutions influence states' external conflict behavior. I am also examining how political turnovers and domestic institutions shape the foreign aid competition between superpowers, namely the US and China.

Methodologically, I adopt a mixed-method approach to studying social phenomenon, combining quantitative cross-sectional time-series techniques with qualitative archive studies and interviews. I can implement methods such as generalized linear models, time-series analysis, and network analysis in Stata, R, and Python. I am also a cautious enthusiast of careful and ethical applications of computational methods, specifically LLMs, AI, and machine learning, to solving data challenges in social sciences.

My background & history
========
I received my M.A. from the Department of Political Science at the University of Iowa in 2023. Before Iowa, I earned my B.S. in Political Science and International Relations at Truman State University, Missouri, in 2021.

I am a proud native of Vietnam. Comming from a central province of the Vietnam and now live at the Midwestern region of the US, I am seemingly destined to the middle and agricultural region of wherever I live (funnily enough, my surname in Vietnamese means "corn", a major agricultural product of Iowa and Missouri). 

When I am not doing political sciency things, I love to read, binge-watch TV shows, work out, and travel.
