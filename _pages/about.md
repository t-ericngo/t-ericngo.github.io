Welcome! I am Eric Ngo, a PhD candidate in political science at the University of Iowa. You can also call me Tu or Anh-Tu (my Vietnamese name).

My primary research interests lie at the nexus of international relations, foreign policy, comparative politics, and computational social science (CSS). In my ongoing dissertation project, I explore how networks of political elites influence constraints on the top leader, thereby shaping policy and political outcomes such as international conflict, repression, and elite in-fighting. To do this, I construct an original database of elite networks across countries and years, employing fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to extract information about elites' biographies and relationships.

More broadly, I am interested in the interplay between domestic and international elements and their implications to state behavior. In my other work, I examine how domestic factors such as ethnic inequality and political institutions influence states' external conflict behavior. I am also examining how political turnovers and domestic institutions shape the foreign aid competition between superpowers, namely the US and China.

Methodologically, I employ a wide range of approachs to studying social phenomenon, combining quantitative cross-sectional time-series techniques with qualitative archive studies and interviews. I can implement methods such as generalized linear models, time-series analysis, and network analysis in Stata, R, and Python. I am also a cautious enthusiast of applications of computational methods, specifically LLMs, AI, and machine learning, to solving data challenges in social sciences.

## My background

I received my M.A. from the Department of Political Science at the University of Iowa in 2023. Before Iowa, I earned my B.S. in Political Science and International Relations at Truman State University, Missouri, in 2021.

I am a proud native of Vietnam. Coming from a central province of Vietnam and now studying in the US Midwest, I am destined to stick with the middle regions anywhere I go (funny enough, my surname in Vietnamese means "corn", a major agricultural product of Iowa and Missouri). 

Besides doing political sciency things, I love to read, work out, travel, and occasionally pretend to be a guitar player.

Feel free to reach me via my email ([tu-ngo@uiowa.edu](tu-ngo@uiowa.edu)).
