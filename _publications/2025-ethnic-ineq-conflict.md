How does political inequality among ethnic groups motivate a state to engage in international conflicts? Previous research suggests that ethnic diversity incentivizes states to wage diversionary conflicts to increase national cohesion. Yet, less attention has been paid to why and how such diversity turns into mobilized threats that motivate the leader to start costly international conflicts. This study addresses this gap by proposing that states who exclude large ethnic populations from the political system generate deep grievances along ethnic lines. Such inequality-induced grievances motivate the government to use diversionary conflict in two ways. First, ethnic frustrations make threats against the state more likely. Yet, (full) accommodation of these potential demands is not possible, while repression of large groups alone may not be adequate to keep the regime intact. As such, governments may preemptively prevent future mobilized threats using other convenient solutions – particularly diversionary conflict – to promote nationalism and rally public support. Second, this overall tendency is even further intensified by rapid political shocks – like domestic unrest – that act as a catalyst that turn these grievances into ethnic mobilization, mounting immediate and serious challenges to state survival. In such short-term crises, the state is even more incentivized to use external diversion. Statistical evidence supports this argument. In addition, the findings show that, when states face both severe ethnic inequality and domestic turmoil, they are especially belligerent against external rivals, who provide a clear opportunity for embattled leaders to start conflict and rally the public against a common enemy.
